-- We want to see books that do and donâ€™t have prequels as a true/false list, however we
-- only care about the books borrowed in the month of February. The first column says
-- the book title, the second column tells us whether this book has a prequel or not as
-- true or false and the third column shows when the book was borrowed. This should be
-- sorted by titles alphabetically.

       p.bookid IS NOT NULL AS every,
